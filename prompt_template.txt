[[Project name is Guardian Eye]]
[[Description]]
This project aims to help city crime investigations by using machine vision and AI to analyse CCTV footages to track a person across the entire city. The key part is that the average CCTV footage quality isn't that great and optimizations to be made to process a humongus video footage for each case.
